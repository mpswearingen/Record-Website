Record-Website
Record Web Development is a group of 6 individuals who are setting out to redesign and launch a 
new website for the official CSB/SJU news publication, the Record. Our goal is to create a web site that 
best serves the interests of the student body through value of journalistic communication. We are interested 
in developing an easy-to-use user interface that maximizes the user's experience. We serve both the editors of 
this fine publication and it's loyal readers. And we're awesome.
